# HeCo
*High-resolution heating and cooling profiles based on a lumped-parameters thermodynamic building stock model*

---

## Overview
HeCo is a bottom-up model for the generation of high-resolution (1h, NUTS2) heating and cooling profiles, based on a lumped-parameters thermodynamic model of a given country-wide building stock. The reference building stock is the Italian one, but the model is adaptable to any context.

The source-code is currently released as v.0.1-beta. This should be regarded as a pre-release: it is not yeat accompained by a detailed documentation, but the Python code is fully commented in each line to allow a complete understanding of it. Further details about the conceptual and mathematical model formulation are provided here: https://doi.org/10.18280/ti-ijes.632-434. In addition, an extended journal publication is in progress and will provide further details about the mathematical formulation.

The repository also hosts all the input files used to generate the profiles appearing in the abovementioned study, which may be also used as a reference example. 

## Requirements
The model is developed in Python 3.6, and requires the following libraries:
* numpy
* matplotlib
* math
* random
